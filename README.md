# Slayer

Slayer is based on kwyjibo, see my other repo and please star if you like it.

npm i
npm run dev

once you fire this up it will play two on key instrumentals with a same key acapella over it (like mixng three turntables live). it will mix until it runs out of songs.

if you dont like the songs its playing, hit refresh, it will randomly select a new key and randomly select two new instrumentals and another acapella.
